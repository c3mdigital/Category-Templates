This is a fork of Arron Loege's Category Template plugin to fix some minor bugs and compatibility issues with WordPress 3.0 +

Note:  I am not supporting this plugin. Use as is!

Give your categories and posts their own individual templates.

== Description ==

Easily apply templates to your category archive pages and posts with this plugin.

Valid templates are files placed your theme folder with the following code at the beginning of them:


For Post Templates: Template Name: Blog Template

For Archive Templates: Archive Template: Blog Template


Through this plugin's options panel, you can choose which templates are applied to categories and posts. Even choose their priority over one another. You can even apply a template to an individual post.
Please [report any bugs](http://aarongloege.com/blog/web-development/wordpress/plugins/wordpress-plugin-category-templates/#respond) you come across.

Enjoy!
